We determined that if we couldn't ask any questions, we would say the person mountain biked since they mountain biked 9 times and didn't 5 times. So our error rate was 5 out of 14 or roughly 36%\n","2. Next, if we could ask one question we determined that the question should be about Outlook. Now our error rate was 4 out of 14 or 29%\n","3. Then we determined the next question to ask and reduced the error rate more. And then the next question ...\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In some sense, the algorithm is additive. We start with zero questions with whatever error rate. Add a question and reduce the error rate. Add another question and reduce the rate. And so on.\n","\n","**Additive** is the key word. Let's look at an example, from [Gradient boosting: Distance to target](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/L2-loss.html)  by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard. They ask us to imagine writing the formula for *y* that matches this plot:\n","\n","![](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/images/L2-loss/L2-loss_additive_2.svg)\n","\n","Like the decision tree example above, our first approximation might be simple, perhaps just the y-intercept:\n","\n","$$y = 30$$\n","\n","as shown in the leftmost picture below. \n","\n","![](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/images/L2-loss/L2-loss_additive_3.svg)\n","\n","Next, we may want to add in the slope of the line and get\n","\n","$$y = 30 + x$$\n","\n","and get the middle graph above.  Finally, we add in the squiggle:\n","\n","$$y = 30 + x + sin(x)$$\n","\n","We have decomposed a complex task into subtasks, each refining the previous approximation. So, again, we have an additive algorithm.\n","\n","This approach shouldn't be surprising to us since this is how we typically develop programs. We get some skeleton code working and then incrementally add to it.\n","\n","\n","## Boosting\n","\n","Boosting algorithms work in a similar additive fashion. We first develop a simple model that roughly classifies the data. Next, we add another simple model that is focused on ameliorating the errors of the first. And then we add another and another.\n","\n","$$boosting=model_1 + model_2 + model_3 + ... + model_n$$\n","\n","\n","### How boosting differs from bagging and pasting\n","\n","With bagging and pasting we created a number of decision trees each of which was trained on different data. **One tree did not influence the construction of another.** Thus, each classifier was independent of the others.\n"," \n","\n","#### Boosting\n","Boosting is different. \n","\n","Imagine that we create one decision tree classifier. Let's call it Classifier 1. Classifier 1 doesn't perform with 100% accuracy. \n","\n","Next we create a second decision tree classifier and as part of its training data we will use the instances that Classifier 1 got wrong. Now Classifier 2 isn't perfect either and there will be some instances that both Classifier 1 and Classifier 2 got wrong, and, you guessed it, we will use those instances as part of the training data for Classifier 3.\n","\n","#### 400 Classifiers\n","Suppose we created 400 classifiers using the bagging algorithm. Since each classifier is independent of the others, we can run those 400 in parallel. \n","\n","Now think about boosting for a moment. Can we run those in parallel? Think about it for \n","\n","1. second\n","2. seconds\n","3. seconds\n","4. seconds\n","5. seconds\n","\n","\n","\n","Since one classifier is dependent on the errors of the others it seems like we couldn't run them in parallel and training 400 classifiers  sequentially seems impractical. This is true in general with boosting algorithms but as we will see XGBoost is different.\n","\n","### Gradient Boosting\n","Suppose I am interested in taking my camper van \n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/travato2.png)\n","\n","\n","to White Horse Road Dispersed Camping in Utah.\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/wildHorse.png)\n","\n","And to get there from my home in Santa Fe, I am using an old school paper map.\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/map.png)\n","\n","A route will be something like.\n","\n","$$route = road_0 + road_1 + road_2 + ... + road_n$$\n","\n","To get to White Horse Road, it looks like my best bet is to start by taking I25 to Albuquerque.\n","\n","\n","$$route = i25 $$\n","\n","Now the difference between where I am and where I want to go is Albuquerque to White Horse. So I performed an action and now my new problem is dealing with this new problem of getting from Albuquerque to White Horse\n","\n","From Albuquerque I can take 550 to Farmington\n","\n","$$route = i25  + US550$$\n","\n","and from there take 491 to Monticello Utah\n","\n","\n","$$route = i25  + US550+ US491$$\n","\n","and so on.\n","\n","There are some similarities between this old school mapping and gradient boosting. In gradient boosting we start with a poor model (in our case, we decided to go to Albuquerque). Then we are going to look at the difference between what we want and where we are-- and then take the next step, the delta $\\Delta$. \n","\n","\n","Let's look at a simple example of classification of one feature *x* to predict a label *y*. We will label our prediction $\\hat{y}$. For gradient boosting our formula is\n","\n","$$\\hat{y}=f_0(x) + \\Delta_1(x) + \\Delta_2(x) + ... + \\Delta_m(x)$$\n","\n","Where $\\Delta_1$ is the first improvement, $\\Delta_2$ the second and so on.\n","\n","Gradient Boosting is an ensemble method, meaning that it is built with a number of sub-classifiers. So perhaps a better Utah analogy is that I hitchhike from here to Albuquerque with one person (one 'classifier'), then go to Framington with another and so on.\n","\n","\n","This is the rough intuition of gradient boosting. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In any gradient algorithm there is a parameter called *learning rate* and in a sense it is how big of steps we can take. \n","\n","Suppose we are hiking on a mountain in Utah and suddenly we are fogged in and can't see a thing. We want to get back to our van in the valley.\n","\n","In my 2D Utah it looks like this:\n","\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/gradient1b.png)\n","\n","The yellow dot is us near the top of the mountain and the pinkish red dot is our van. So our algorithm is\n","\n","\n","```\n","WHILE NOT AT VAN OR NOT MOVING:\n","  take one step to the left.\n","  IF we are lower than when we started:\n","     stay here at the new location\n","  ELSE\n","     go back to starting point and go one step to the right\n","     IF we are lower than when we started:\n","        stay here at the new location\n","     ELSE\n","        go back to starting point\n","```\n","\n","We repeat the above procedure and get to the state shown on the right above. If we take a step to the right or left we go uphill so we are stuck. We hit what is called a local minima and local minima are a problem with all gradient descent algorithms.\n","\n","Perhaps the one step was too small an increment. So let's say we have a rope. You stay where we are and hold one end of the rope and I walk until I reach the end of the rope. Based on the angle of the rope, we see if I am lower or not and we move accordingly. Now we jump over that local minima and reach a state that looks like the following image on the left. We don't know it, but we are almost to the van!\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/gradient2b.png)\n","\n","We use the rope technique again but this time I jump over the location of our van since I am not at the end of the rope yet and am in the position shown on the right. The learning rate was too large. (Now I am sounding like the three bears tale!)\n","\n","The one step was our learning rate as was our rope technique and you can see that selecting a good one is crucial. \n","\n","#### Loss Function\n","For both these examples, one thing we needed was a measure for how far away are we from our goal. Are we better or worse? For the fog on a mountain example, the loss function was our altitude and we are trying to reduce the loss -- the altitude. \n","\n","\n","### Two more examples\n","\n","#### One Dimensional Team Frisbee Golf\n","Here is my representation of our 1D golf game. The hole is the green circle on the right and our frisbee's location is shown with the lovely pink circle on the left. Let $y$ be the actual distance between the two and $x$ what I see standing by the frisbee--off in the one dimensional distance I see the hole. \n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/golf1.png)\n","\n","\n","It is player zero's turn and she estimates the distance to be 70 yards.\n","\n","$$f_0(x) = 70$$ \n","\n","She flings the frisbee and ...\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/golf2.png)\n","\n","Now it is player two's turn. He is only concerned with the  difference, the $\\Delta_1$ --the current position of the frisbee and the location of the hole. He estimates it to be 20 yards\n","\n","$$\\Delta_1(x) = 20$$\n","\n","So far we have flung the frisbee\n","\n","$$\\hat{y}= f+0(x) + \\Delta_1(x) = 70 + 20 = 90$$\n","\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/golf3.png)\n","\n","Now it is player two's turn. She estimates the distance remaining ($\\Delta_2$) to be 15 yards...\n","\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/golf4.png)\n","\n","And she overshot. \n","\n","Player three estimates the remaining distance to be -5 yards and ...\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/golf5.png)\n","\n","Notice that each player is not concerned with the original problem. She is just concerned with the **residual** --- meaning what is remaining based on the previous players' results.\n","\n","The formula is \n","\n","$$\\hat{y} = f_0(x) + \\Delta_1(x) + \\Delta_2(x) + ... + \\Delta_m(x)$$\n","$$=f_0(x) + \\sum_{m=1}^M{\\Delta_m(x)}$$\n","\n","So the first classifier works on the original problem but all the rest work on the residual.\n","\n","\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/divider.png)\n","\n","### Expenditures on Makeup and Clothes\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/labs/pics/makeup33.png)\n","Ok, I have exhausted my creativity, so even though I am not keen on this example, let's go back to predicting a young lady's expenditure on makeup based on what she spends on clothes.

It uses Numpy for high performance matrix operations. \n","\n","The best bet, as with probably everything else, is just to google what you want. For example, if you want to learn how to use kNN (k nearest neighbors) with sklearn, google **sklearn knn**  and you will find the information. The good thing about sklearn documentation, is that they provide a short example of how to use each algorithm.\n","\n","That said, let's get started.\n","\n","\n","### Women Athletes\n","\n","\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/rass.png)\n","<font size='0.85em'>(Credit: Aly Raisman/Instagram)</font> \n","\n","(Left to right: Liz Cambage (Australian Olympic Basksetball Team, Aly Raisman (U.S. Olympic Gymnast)\n","\n","We are going to start with something that people find very easy: Based on height and weight, guessing what sport (basketball or gymnastics) an athlete plays at a world class level.

From the examples in the training set, they build an internal representation, a model, of the relationship between the features and the labels. Once the algorithm builds this model it 'forgets' the individual data instances. Such ML algorithms are called eager learners. On the other hand, a lazy learner does not build a model beforehand. It remembers all the training instances and when it needs to make a prediction on a new instance it then processes all the training data. \n","\n","kNN is a lazy learner.

To the second? And to the 98 other athletes in our small dataset. As you can imagine, this takes some time. So fitting is fast because it doesn't actually build a model but predicting is slow.\n","\n","### Three kNN algorithms\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/kdtree.png)\n","There are three basic kNN algorithms: \n","\n","* **brute** which uses a brute force method we described above.\n","* **[kd_tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree)** which, when you are fitting, creates a binary tree. This makes prediction faster. \n","* **[ball_tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_tree)** which also creates a binary tree during training (fitting)\n","\n","Since this is our first machine learning algorithm, we won't get too bogged down in learning about kd trees and ball trees, but let's cover a few things. First, since the algorithm needs to construct a binary tree when it fits the data, fitting takes longer but with that binary tree, prediction is faster. That is the trade off. For both trees, a binary tree is constructed that divides the training data into a number of sets that have a specific size limit known as leaf size, which is a hyperparameter of the algorithm. When we specify a large leaf size, the depth of the constructed binary tree will be shallow and the amount of time constructing the tree will be reduced. When we specify a smaller leaf size, training time will be increased but predictions will be faster. \n","\n","When we did `knn.get_params()` we saw\n","\n","```\n","{'algorithm': 'auto',\n"," 'leaf_size': 30,\n"," 'metric': 'minkowski',\n"," 'metric_params': None,\n"," 'n_jobs': None,\n"," 'n_neighbors': 3,\n"," 'p': 2,\n"," 'weights': 'uniform'}\n","```\n","\n","The first line:\n","\n","```\n","'algorithm': 'auto',\n","```\n","\n","as you can guess, displays the algorithm used. The options are:\n","\n","* `brute`\n","* `kd_tree`\n","* `ball_tree`\n","* `auto`\n","\n","The default is `auto` which simply allows the algorithm itself to determine the best algorithm to use based on the training data.\n","\n","We can specify the algorithm by using the `algorithm` hyperparameter:\n","\n","```\n","knn = KNeighborsClassifier(algorithm='brute', n_neighbors=3)\n","```\n","\n","The next line\n","\n","```\n","'leaf_size': 30,\n","```\n","\n","displays the leaf size which we just talked about. 30 is the default value. The optimal value is dependent on the problem. You can set it by\n","\n","\n","```\n","knn = KNeighborsClassifier(algorithm='brute', leaf_size=10, n_neighbors=3)\n","```\n","The next line\n","```\n","'metric': 'minkowski',\n","```\n","\n","specifies the distance metric we are using. Minkowski is the default.  Its strength is in working with real values. If you are dealing with boolean or integer values other metrics may be a better fit.\n","\n","Finally,\n","```\n","'weights': 'uniform'}\n","```\n","\n","As we know, when we use k=3, the three closest neighbors get a vote in determining the classification of the new instance. If 2 say 'Basketball' and one 'Gymnastics'  we classify the new instance as Basketball. In this case, all three neighbors have an equal, or uniform, vote. That's what this `'weights': 'uniform'` specifies. But suppose we want the closest neighbor to have more weight in the vote than the others. In that case we could use `weights='distance'`, where the weight of each vote is the inverse of the distance.\n","\n","\n"," This long description was intended to peel away some of the mystery, and not to bore or confuse you. \n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/datamining-guide/master/labs/pics/divider.png)\n","\n","\n","\n","### let's classify something\n","\n","Nneka Ogwumike is 6'2\" or 74 inches and weighs 174 and Leklani Mitchell is 5'5\" and 132 pounds.
